Text to be shown for why we are asking for details that we are:

> Why do we ask for personal details? What you share about your personal situation is entirely up to you, we have added some of these markers to map where violence occurs and who it affects. At Trans/form, we believe in being specific so we can challenge and clarify what mainstream narratives often generalise into a single story.
