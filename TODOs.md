TODOs

Helloo adding list of changes for trans/form here:

✅ Meet the team - we want to have more of a separation between current team and alumni - can we make it like it is on LSR website? Current team appears immediately, no heading needed. Alumni ke liye there is a heading neeche. I love them but we can remove 'crew' and 'alumni' boxes all together.

✅ Affirmative Action Page - can we have an option to add images to these entries? Some might have images and others might not.

3. contact and submit: contribute your lived experience -
   a. ✅ 'Add your lived experience here' - Can we add a word limit over here? 350/400 words maybe?
   b. related to collecting age and location, would love your input on if theres a better way to go about this:

- instead of only 'age and location' we want to identify the age and location of the person when the violence occurred. we are thinking we can add field saying 'Where did this happen and how old were you?' description can be: We collect this information to map the age range at which trans individuals experience violence, helping us identify patterns and vulnerabilities across different life stages. It also helps us identify areas with less representation and to analyze how regional socio-cultural norms may contribute to violent attitudes towards trans people. We would like to have this information appear on the site under 'lived experiences', potentially under the name they have submitted.
- we can merge the present age/location fields into one: 'current age and location'. description can be - We collect this information to help understand the demographics of those who use trans/form, as well as understand how much time has passed since they experienced transphobic violence.

c. on the tool pages, there will be a limit to how many lived experiences appear right? I'm guessing we should only have 5-6 before it stars to get too cluttered? Is there a possibility of adding a 'view more lived experiences' button at the bottom. I am open to thinking about what kind of page this leads to (i.e. dedicated page for that particular permutation of gender identity and violence, page with all submitted lived experiences, etc.)

d. ✅ Is there some kind of message we can add at the bottom after people submit? like, Thank you for sharing you lived experience with us, your entry has been recorded. Please reach out to us at transformsouthasia@gmail.com in case of any questions or support.
