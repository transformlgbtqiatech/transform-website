name: transmisogynistic
---
Refers to attitudes, behaviours, or systems that combine transphobia and misogyny, specifically targeting trans women and trans feminine individuals. This form of oppression is rooted in the intersection of anti-transgender prejudice and the devaluation of femininity, often manifesting as discrimination, harassment, violence, or systemic exclusion. Transmisogyny disproportionately impacts trans women and trans feminine people, reinforcing patriarchal norms and gender hierarchies by punishing those who deviate from traditional gender expectations. It is a key concept in understanding the unique forms of violence and marginalization faced by trans women and trans feminine individuals.&#x20;
