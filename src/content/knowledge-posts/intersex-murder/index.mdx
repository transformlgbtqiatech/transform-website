Intersex transgender persons are particularly vulnerable to acts of fatal violence, homicide, and murder, not only on account of the systemic and institutional stigma surrounding their gender identity, but also the pathologisation of their intersex bodies, which resist compartmentalisation into rigid sex and gender binaries. This is compounded by patriarchal notions of honour, superstition, and dogma. 

\
Regardless of whether they are cis or trans, violence is perpetrated against intersex persons since they are of a young age, sometimes even at the neonatal stage when atypical differences in their genitalia become known, often leading to neonaticide and infanticide.  Such violence is commonly documented and researched in eastern and southern Africa and South Asia. The perpetrators of this violence are often medical personnel such as: doctors, midwives, traditional healers, and birth attendants; primary caretakers like parents and relatives. This honour killing is often conspired by domestic circles and is justified by the perpetrators as an ‘act of love’ by saving the family from questions from the community, as well as protecting the community from the misfortune that the intersex child will bring. At other times, the birth of an intersex child is attributed to angry ancestors, the embodiment of sorcery by the mother/child or a curse from God. 

\
Neonaticide and infanticide against intersex children often goes unreported to formal legal authorities such as police personnel due to the secrecy and stigma surrounding giving birth to an intersex child. In many cases, the mother is also not informed by the medical practitioner or relative that the child was killed and is instead told that she gave birth to a stillborn child. The only source of data on this violence is informal interviews conducted by researchers with medical personnel and parents of murdered intersex children.

\
There is a dire lack of data on violence faced by trans intersex persons since this intersection is easily overlooked or misunderstood. Hate crimes and murder often go unreported, underreported or misreported due to misgendering of the victim, especially when they do not fit into the sex binary, or their intersex status is  concealed by the victim’s domestic circles due to the fear of shame upon revelation. Currently, there is no social or legal recognition of intersex identity, and crimes against intersex persons are clubbed with cisgender persons or trans persons, thereby invisibilising the unique violence they face. The misrepresentation of intersex people, alongside the lack of targeted legal frameworks and redressal mechanisms, sustains the cycle of violence by ensuring that most victims are never brought to justice.
