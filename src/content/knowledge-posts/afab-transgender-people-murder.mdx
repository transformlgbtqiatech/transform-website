Gender non-conforming and non-binary folx who are assigned female at birth (hereon referred to as <Glossary glossaryTerm="afab" />) are particularly vulnerable to acts of fatal violence, homicide, and murder on account of the systemic and institutional stigma surrounding their <Footnote inlineText="gender identity" footNoteText="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

Patriarchal social structures and misogyny work in tandem to control and condition the bodies of AFAB people by valuing them only as mothers and caregivers. From an early age, they are conditioned to view marriage and motherhood as the only acceptable goals. Such ideals disproportionately affect masculine presenting and/or identifying trans men who face violence for allegedly ‘abandoning’ their role of motherhood and childbirth. Resistance to such biological determinism as well as cis-heteronormative expectations of marriage put trans men at risk of hostile sexism at the hands of people in their domestic circles – such as primary caregivers, intimate partners and cohabitants – as well as employers, colleagues, police forces or even bigoted strangers. Trans men are also at risk of institutional murder on account of medical negligence, especially during gender-affirming procedures. Additionally, experiencing bullying, harassment and transphobia at the workplace or educational institutions with no mechanism in place to protect them increases the number of AFAB people who die by suicide, another form of institutional murder. If not resulting in fatal violence, attempts made on the lives of trans men leave long-lasting impacts on the victim’s physical, mental and psychological health.

AFAB folx are disproportionately vulnerable to experiencing transphobic hate crimes, institutional murder and state violence. Some may be more vulnerable to structural violence owing to marginalisation along multiple axes, including populations such as trans/non-binary youth, poor trans people, Dalit/Adivasi AFAB people, disabled non-binary/trans people, homeless trans/non-binary individuals, etc. Though research may provide some insight, data on the murders of AFAB people tends to be scarce, scattered, and limited since they often go unreported, underreported, or misrepresented as violence against women. This is because AFAB folx are commonly deadnamed and misgendered as ‘female’ – often when the victim has not come out, their family tries to hide their trans identity or due to anti-trans animus.

Although violence against women has specific legal redressal provisions, there is a serious lack of redressal mechanisms that protect AFAB folx. This, alongside the misrepresentation of violence they face invisibilises transmasculine identities and makes it difficult to hold perpetrators accountable for their actions who are often let off with lenient punishment if at all the case is investigated and taken to court. As a result, most victims are never brought to justice and the cycle of violence subsists.
