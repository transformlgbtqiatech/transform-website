Gender non-conforming and non-binary folx who are assigned female at birth (hereon referred to as <Glossary glossaryTerm="afab" />) are particularly vulnerable to being scapegoated and jailed on account of the systemic and institutional stigma [**surrounding**](https://google.com) their gender identity and expression, prejudice against transgender people, as well as patriarchal notions surrounding AFAB bodies. They are vulnerable to being targeted and forcefully detained by the police, on the basis of false allegations, for reasons ranging from prejudice against AFAB folx to moral disgust stemming from misinformation, lack of awareness, and outdated beliefs [related](https://google.com) to trans persons. It is for these reasons that AFAB folx from working-class backgrounds, who are Dalit/Bahujan or Adivasi, disabled, or sex workers, are particularly vulnerable to being scapegoated and <Footnote text="inline text">this is a [footnote](https://google.com) text</Footnote>

The scapegoating <Footnote>whatever it is [here](https://google.com) is</Footnote> of AFAB folxs is often weaponised by people in their domestic circles, including intimate partners, chosen family and cohabitants who may falsely accuse them of crimes to blackmail or control them. For example, transmasc folx with ‘feminine’ mannerisms are often subjected to the same scrutiny and charges of perversion that gay men are often accused of. AFAB folx who are parents <Footnote text="may">what is this wonderful [thing](https://fb.com)</Footnote> even be declared unfit to care for or gain custody of their child/children. There have been many cases where they have been unjustly accused of being paedophiles or of ‘grooming’ children in order to abuse them

While police personnel reserve the authority to detain and incarcerate individuals, they may be complicit when the perpetrators are political actors, lawmakers and others with socio-political power. For example, widespread transphobia, anti-trans sentiments, and other hateful rhetorics – often in the form of statements – made by public figures with social capital like politicians or celebrities can inflame mobs and result in organised anti-trans violence. Victims of may be threatened further if they decide to speak out and report their experiences of being scapegoated.

Scapegoating need not lead to incarceration; however, it could cause targeted damage to livelihood, a loss of reputation, physical and sexual [abuse](https://transformsouthasia.com/glossary/abuse) or assault, or microaggressions. In cases that it might, incarcerated [AFAB](https://transformsouthasia.com/glossary/afab) folx are vulnerable to facing interpersonal violence, threats to their safety and privacy, and physical and verbal [abuse](https://transformsouthasia.com/glossary/abuse) at the hands of prison authorities and fellow inmates. Wrongful incarceration and unfair treatment within the prison system can lead to long-term mental and psychological distress, and interfere with the victim’s access to gender-affirming healthcare.

Ultimately, a lack of police protection also leaves them further vulnerable to [abuse](https://transformsouthasia.com/glossary/abuse), assault, threats to life and property, and blackmail from other perpetrators. The fear of harassment at the hands of police also inhibits [AFAB](https://transformsouthasia.com/glossary/afab) persons from filing complaints as well as from seeking post-assault care at medical facilities. When scapegoated, they might be incarcerated for crimes they have not even committed if they cannot afford a lawyer. Legal advice can be expensive and many victims may not be offered pro-bono consultations.

Though research may provide some insight, data tends to be scarce, scattered, and limited since the scapegoating and imprisonment of [AFAB](https://transformsouthasia.com/glossary/afab) people often goes unreported, removed from records or misreported, especially when the victim is misgendered. Since police personnel and prison authorities are among the perpetrators, there are virtually no avenues for incarcerated [AFAB](https://transformsouthasia.com/glossary/afab) people to seek redressal. The lack of targeted legal frameworks and redressal mechanisms helps sustain the cycle of violence by ensuring most victims are never brought to justice. Thus, scapegoating and jailing lead to the degradation of [AFAB](https://transformsouthasia.com/glossary/afab) persons’ lives, making them more vulnerable to fatal violence.
