The <span class="text-orange-transform font-medium">LIVED EXPERIENCES</span> section is a space for transgender people who identify as part of various intersectional social groups to share their personal stories. These narratives are crucial for building evidence. Since Transform aims to inform research and policy, the personal stories of trans people are just as valuable as any report or study included in this tool.

The <a href="/glossary"class="border-b-2 border-orange-transform no-underline"><span class="text-orange-transform font-medium">GLOSSARY</span></a> is designed to help understand the language used in this tool, including specific terms that might be frequently used but not easily understood. It can also be accessed from the main menu.

      reading, or take a break and return when you feel ready.
