This section provides an overview of how the <span class="text-red-transform italic">[transgender identity group]</span> you selected experiences the <span class="text-red-transform italic">[violence type]</span> you chose to learn more about. It delves into the reasons this group is subjected to <Glossary glossaryTerm="transphobic" /> and <Glossary glossaryTerm="transmisogynistic" /> violence, identifies the perpetrators, examines why these cases are often overlooked or misreported, and discusses the availability of redressal mechanisms for victims, survivors, and their families.

Violence against transgender people is categorised into three broad, colour-coded levels based on impact and severity[^1]:

[^1]: Trans/form is adapted from the [rape culture pyramid](https://www.11thprincipleconsent.org/consent-propaganda/rape-culture-pyramid/), which illustrates how societal behaviors and attitudes contribute to a culture that enables sexual violence. Our adaptation focuses on the specific experiences of violence faced by transgender individuals, highlighting the escalation from normalisation to degradation, and ultimately to assault.

<ColorExplanation />

<b class="text-yellow-transform">Normalisation</b> includes a range of transmisogynistic
behaviours which perpetuate and encourage violence against the transgender community.
This includes non-factual media portrayal, marginalisation, othering, stereotyping,
objectification and cisgender heterosexual misogyny.

‘Normalisation’ leads to the further <b class="text-orange-transform">Degradation</b> of transgender lives through verbal assault, cyberbullying, transmedicalism, within legal frameworks and documentation, and through scapegoating and jailing transgender people.

‘Normalisation’ and ‘Degradation’ eventually lead to serious crimes of physical or sexual abuse and <b class="text-red-transform">Assault</b> against transgender people, of which perpetrators could include members of domestic circles, caregivers, police and government forces, co-workers, bosses or complete strangers.

The <span class="text-orange-transform font-medium">LIVED EXPERIENCES</span> section is a space for transgender people who identify as part of various intersectional social groups to share their personal stories. These narratives are crucial for building evidence. Since Transform aims to inform research and policy, the personal stories of trans people are just as valuable as any report or study included in this tool.

The <a href="/glossary"class="border-b-2 border-orange-transform no-underline"><span class="text-orange-transform font-medium">GLOSSARY</span></a> is designed to help understand the language used in this tool, including specific terms that might be frequently used but not easily understood.
