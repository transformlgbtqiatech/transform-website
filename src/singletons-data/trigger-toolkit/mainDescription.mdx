Welcome to our Trigger Toolkit! This space has been made to take
you away from the possibly triggering/scary stuï¬€ that you may be
reading on trans/form.

Here, you will find some simple exercises to help you regulate
your breathing and ground you to your surroundings.

If you would like to contribute to our toolkit, you can do so here.
