This page is dedicated to work that has been created by the community in vernacular languages about their lived experiences as Trans people in a transmisogynistic society so that the amount of work done in languages beyond English can also be archived and accessed by Trans/form’s visitors. Do you know of vernacular language  articles and resources by transgender people on experiences? [Let us know from here!](https://transformsouthasia.com/contact-submit)
