With Trans/form, we want to make space for more Trans people
to work in trans led/run environments, and we hope to make this
an evidence collection mechanism that we can use to advocate
for ourselves. There are many ways to contribute to the tool; you
can add your narrative, links and information to the tool. You can
also review the tool when we call for reviewers periodically.

And if you are an ally/friend, you can buy us a Kofi!
