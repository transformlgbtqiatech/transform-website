Transform seeks to bridge this gap by serving as an
inclusionary collaborative platform helping dismantle and
educate on trans experiences as narrated and reviewed by
Trans people. The scope of Transform makes it adaptable in
educational institutes; a self-educational resource wherein
users of all ages and abilities can filter and control the content
they interact with about trans identities and trans personsâ€™
lived experiences of violence, marginalization, and
transmisogyny; and public cyberspace encouraging
interdisciplinary cross-cultural learning and advocacy. As a
design-intensive microsite complete with a unique trigger
warning and consent tools that bring control into the hands of
each user, it will be a one-of-a-kind accessible tool advocating
for better policy, and a progressive movement creating spaces
for the trans community in a disproportionately violent world.
