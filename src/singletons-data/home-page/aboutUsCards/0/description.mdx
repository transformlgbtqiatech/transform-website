Initiatives emphasising intersectionality in violence faced by
the trans community do not exist, thus largely invisibilizing
distinctive atrocities various identity groups face on account of
their gender identity as well as religion, sexuality, ability, caste,
occupation, ethnicity and so on. The knowledge available in
these spheres is generally scattered and inaccessible to the
majority, which in turn fuels misinformation leading to
stigmatization and superficial stereotyping. Moreover,
knowledge and evidence that has been historically created by
Trans people are often not taken seriously, and thus not used
in research and policy work that impacts our lives.

Transform was first conceptualised as a ‘trans version’ of the
rape culture pyramid, which is popularly used as a tool to
understand how ‘small acts’ of violence that go unchecked
often lead to ‘big acts’ of violence that are not taken seriously.
As we continued building the tool, the shape of the pyramid
did not serve the purpose we had in mind: to show that
violence is cyclical, and that understanding the structural
nature of violence is the only way to tackle it. We also did not
want the information on Transform to be reductive to a few
words, phrases and communities- so we let it get big to
encompass as many people as possible in all our
communities. We then took it to our first set of reviewers to
tell us what they thought about the project and its scope.
